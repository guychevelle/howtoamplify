Process:
name: Create React project and GitHub repository
description: An auto-generated React project will be the basis for all examples
picturekey:

Steps:

stepnum: 1
name: Install Node.js and NPM
description: You will run your site on your local machine using Node.js. All tools will be installed using NPM (Node Package Manager).
steptextkey:
Reader will need to navigate to a site to download and install Node/NPM media
link to macOS install is at https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/#how-to-install-nodejs-on-macos

use command 'node --version' to verify installed Node.js version

$ node --version
v16.14.2
$ npm --version
8.6.0

stepnum: 2
name: Create a React project
description: Use the create-react-app command to create your first project.
steptextkey:
It is advised to create a local directory under which all other local projects can be managed.  Since examples will be AWS Amplify specific, create an 'amplify' directory under your user home directory.

$ mkdir amplify
$ cd amplify
$ pwd
/Users/<my home dir>/amplify

Now create your first React project using the below command:

$ npx create-react-app testapp

The result of the command will be to create a 'testapp' subdirectory with initial Node files.  To confirm the project was craeted successfully, change your directory to the project directory and start the local site.

$ cd testapp
$ npm start

A simple React page is rendered in your browser. You can stop site execution by entering Ctrl-C in the terminal session to stop npm execution.

stepnum: 3
name: Create a GitHub repository
description: Not only is it best practice to save code in a version repository like GitHub, the repository will also be needed by AWS to host your site in the cloud.
steptextkey:
Login to your GitHub account and select the '+' in the top right menu bar and select the 'New repository' option from the dropdown menu.

stepnum: 4
name: Create the new repository
description: You can select to create either a Public or Private repository.
steptextkey:
After entering the new repository name, click on the 'Create repository' button.

stepnum: 5
name: Push your initial code to GitHub
description: Create a main branch and push committed code to the remote GitHub repository.
steptextkey:
Execute the below commands to add your project to the remote GitHub repository in a branch called 'main'.

$ git remote add origin <your new GitHub repository URL>
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main

stepnum: 6
name: Verify GitHub repository branch content
description: Navigate to your new repository in GitHub from your browser and confirm code is represented in the 'main' branch.
